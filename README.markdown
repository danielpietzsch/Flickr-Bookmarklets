# Flickr Bookmarklets

So far, this project consists of only *one* bookmarklet in three different versions.  
Every Bookmarklet does the same, but the output format is different.

Executing the bookmarklet on a Flickr picture page (i.e. the page with comments, tags etc.) it copies the address of that image, wraps it in a link and displays this code in the chosen syntax. You can then copy this code into your clipboard and paste it somewhere else (f.e. your blog).

The output choices are:

* [BBCode](http://www.phpbb.com/community/faq.php?mode=bbcode),
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or
* export for [Travellerspoint](http://www.travellerspoint.com/).

Travellerspoint is a travel website, which uses a syntax similar to BBCode. I have [my travel blog](http://downunder.travellerspoint.com/) there. The original motivation to create these bookmarklets was to make it easy for me to paste images from [my Flickr stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pie4dan/) into this travel blog.

Head over to the [Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/pie4dan/Flickr-Bookmarklets) to drag these bookmarklets directly to your browser's bookmarks/favorites bar.
